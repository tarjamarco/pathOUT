    "clean_content": "Grossing for diagnosis\n\n* Cut perpendicular to long axis if possible* Avoid squeezing nodes, which may alter histology* For culture (if clinically indicated) or for flow cytometry, use end of lymph node* For touch imprints, fix in ethanol, stain with H&E, Wright stain or use for immunocytochemistry* Use scrapes / cell suspension for flow cytometry, cytogenetics, molecular gene rearrangement studies, FISH* Sections for formalin or B5 fixation should be 3 - 4 mm thick to allow for proper fixation; B5 (mercury containing fixative) provides best morphologic details* Snap freezing is best for research, some immunohistochemistry, future molecular studies* Formalin fixation is best for PCR* EM is helpful only rarely to diagnose Langerhans histiocytosis or occasionally metastatic tumors* Include extranodal fat (infiltration implies malignant process)* **Note**: the most important slides to obtain are sufficient H&E for diagnosis* Frozen sections may confirm involvement of node by a disease process, but do not use to obtain a specific diagnosis because freezing artifacts may hinder diagnosis"
