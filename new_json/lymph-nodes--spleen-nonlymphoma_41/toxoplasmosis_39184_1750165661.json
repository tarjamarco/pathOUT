    "clean_content": "Sample pathology report\n\n* Lymph node, right inguinal, excisional biopsy:\n  + Reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, monocytoid B cell hyperplasia and aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes, suggestive of toxoplasma lymphadenitis (see comment)+ Comment: The classic triad present in this case (follicular hyperplasia, intrafollicular clusters of epithelioid cells and aggregates of monocytes) is reported to have a 91% specificity for toxoplasma lymphadenitis. There is no evidence of lymphoma. The morphologic findings are very suggestive of toxoplasmosis. Serologic studies are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.+ Microscopic description:\n        - Right cervical lymph node: The lymph node is enlarged and has a preserved architecture with a thin capsule and open sinuses. There is evidence of reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia. In addition, numerous small, well defined aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes are noted, including within the germinal centers. Focally, monocytoid B cell hyperplasia is present. There is no morphologic evidence of lymphoma.- Special stains for AFB and GMS are negative for microorganisms.- Immunohistochemical staining performed on block A1 shows that the CD20+ B cells are confined to the germinal centers, while the CD3+ T cells are interfollicular. Monocytoid B cells also express CD20. Immunohistochemical stain for toxoplasma is positive. There is no staining for cytomegalovirus. In situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) is negative.- Note: Control slides show appropriate reactivity.- Left inguinal lymph node for flow cytometry:\n                  * The following analytes were tested: Kappa, Lambda, CD5, CD23, CD10, CD20, CD19, CD45, sCD3, CD57, CD4, CD7, CD8, CD2 (total of 14)+ Flow cytometry interpretation:\n          - Cytospin: Morphologic evaluation of Diff-Quik stained cytospin shows no increase in atypical lymphocytes.- Flow cytometry: Analysis was performed with the above antigens. The T cells show no loss of pan T cell antigens. The B cells are polytypic. The findings provide no evidence of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
