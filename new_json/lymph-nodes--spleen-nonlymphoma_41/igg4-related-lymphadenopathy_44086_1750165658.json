    "clean_content": "Sample pathology report\n\n* Lymph node, excision:\n  + Enlarged lymph node with fibrosis and increased IgG4 positive plasma cells (see comment)+ Comment: The lymph node is enlarged with follicular hyperplasia, capsular fibrosis and foci of parenchymal fibrosis. There are frequent plasma cells with fewer admixed eosinophils within the regions of fibrosis and present between follicles. Immunohistochemistry for IgG4 and IgG show increased IgG4 positive plasma cells (up to 165 per HPF) and IgG4:IgG ratio of ~70% within interfollicular and fibrotic regions. Plasma cells demonstrate polytypic expression of kappa and lambda light chains by in situ hybridization. A spirochete (*Treponema*) immunostain is negative.+ Increased IgG4 positive plasma cells may be seen in lymph nodes in various conditions including IgG4 related disease, Castleman disease and other inflammatory and infectious processes. The presence of increased IgG4 staining parameters within fibrosis and interfollicular regions of enlarged lymph nodes, as seen in this case, has been described as a relatively specific finding for IgG4 related disease. Therefore, in this patient without a history of established extranodal IgG4 related disease, the findings are suspicious for IgG4 related lymphadenopathy; however, further investigation for an extranodal site of IgG4 related disease and laboratory testing including serum IgG4, IgE and complement (C3 / C4) levels may be useful for definitive diagnosis of IgG4 related disease."
