The lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate within the lymph node parenchyma is cytologically unremarkable. Immunohistochemistry shows that the atypical histiocytes within the lymph node sinuses are positive for CD68, CD163 with coexpression of S100, OCT2 and cyclin D1. They are negative for BRAF V600E by immunohistochemistry. There is no increase in the number of IgG4 positive plasma cells or an abnormal IgG4/IgG ratio.
