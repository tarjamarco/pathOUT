Begins at the junction of the wet and dry mucosa of the lip (the anterior border of the portion of the lip that comes into contact with the opposed lip) and extends posteriorly into the oral cavity to the attached gingiva of the alveolar ridge- Dry vermilion lip and vermilion border are staged using the chapter on cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck; this is a change from past AJCC editions where the dry vermilion was included in the lip and oral cavity chapter+ **Buccal mucosa:**\n      - Includes all the mucous membrane lining of the inner surface of the cheeks and lips from the line of contact of the opposing lips to the line of attachment of mucosa of the alveolar ridge (upper and lower) and pterygomandibular raphe+ **Lower alveolar ridge:**\n        - Refers to the mucosa overlying the alveolar process of the mandible, which extends from the line of attachment of mucosa in the lower gingivobuccal sulcus to the line of attachment of free mucosa of the floor of the mouth- Posteriorly, it extends to the ascending ramus of the mandible+ **Upper alveolar ridge:**\n          - Refers to the mucosa overlying the alveolar process of the maxilla, which extends from the line of attachment of mucosa in the upper gingivobuccal sulcus to the junction of the hard palate- Its posterior margin is the upper end of the pterygopalatine arch+ **Retromolar gingiva (retromolar trigone):**\n            - Attached mucosa overlying the ascending ramus of the mandible from the level of the posterior surface of the last lower molar tooth to the apex superiorly, adjacent to the tuberosity of the maxilla+ **Floor of the mouth:**\n              - Crescentic surface overlying the mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles, extending from the inner surface of the lower alveolar ridge to the undersurface of the tongue- Its posterior boundary is the base of the anterior pillar of the tonsil- It is divided into 2 sides by the frenulum of the tongue and harbors the ostia of the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands+ **Hard palate:**\n                - Semilunar area between the upper alveolar ridge and the mucous membrane covering the palatine process of the maxillary palatine bones- It extends from the inner surface of the superior alveolar ridge to the posterior edge of the palatine bone+ **Anterior two - thirds of the tongue (oral tongue):**\n                  - Freely mobile portion of the tongue that extends anteriorly from the line of circumvallate papillae to the undersurface of the tongue at the junction with the floor of the mouth- It is composed of 4 areas: the tip, the lateral borders, the dorsum and the undersurface (nonvillous ventral surface of the tongue)- Undersurface of the tongue is considered a separate category by the World Health Organization (WHO)* **Tumor thickness (TT) versus depth of invasion (DOI)** ([AJCC: Cancer Staging [Accessed 21 September 2018]](https://cancerstaging.org/Pages/default.aspx), [CAP: Protocol for the Examination of Specimens from Patients with Cancers of the Lip and Oral Cavity [Accessed 29 December 2020]](https://cap.objects.frb.io/protocols/cp-headandneck-lip-oralcavity-17protocol-4001.pdf)):\n    + Tumor thickness is usually measured from the mucosal surface of the tumor to the deepest point of tissue invasion in a perpendicular fashion with a measuring instrument+ DOI is measured from the basement membrane of an adjacent normal to the deepest point of invasion of the tumor\n        - DOI assesses the invasiveness of a carcinoma, regardless of any exophytic component- It is measured by first finding the \"horizon\" of the basement membrane of the adjacent squamous mucosa- Perpendicular \"plumb line\" is established from this horizon to the deepest point of tumor invasion, which represents DOI- DOI is recorded in millimeters+ See figures 2A and 2B in [Microscopic (histologic) images](#oralcavitytnmmicroimages)+ **Extrinsic tongue muscle (ETM) invasion** ([AJCC: Cancer Staging [Accessed 21 September 2018]](https://cancerstaging.org/Pages/default.aspx), [CAP: Protocol for the Examination of Specimens from Patients with Cancers of the Lip and Oral Cavity [Accessed 29 December 2020]](https://cap.objects.frb.io/protocols/cp-headandneck-lip-oralcavity-17protocol-4001.pdf)):\n            - No longer used as a component of pT4 staging because this is a feature of DOI- No longer a staging criterion for T4 designation in oral cavity because depth of invasion supersedes it and extrinsic muscle invasion is difficult to assess (both clinically and pathologically)* **Surgical margins** ([AJCC: Cancer Staging [Accessed 21 September 2018]](https://cancerstaging.org/Pages/default.aspx), [CAP: Protocol for the Examination of Specimens from Patients with Cancers of the Lip and Oral Cavity [Accessed 29 December 2020]](https://cap.objects.frb.io/protocols/cp-headandneck-lip-oralcavity-17protocol-4001.pdf)):\n      + Definition of a positive margin is somewhat controversial given the varied results from prior studies+ However, overall, several studies support the definition of a positive margin to be invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ / high grade dysplasia present at margins (microscopic cut through of tumor)+ Furthermore, reporting of surgical margins should also include information regarding the distance of invasive carcinoma, carcinoma in situ or high grade dysplasia (moderate to severe) from the surgical margin* **Tumor bed versus specimen margins:**\n        + Regarding what actually represents the relevant margin status, it becomes increasingly clear that margins obtained from the main resection specimen are of more reliable prognostic value\n          - Clinical value of tumor bed margins (i.e. margins taken separately) is often undermined by their uncertain origin with respect to the main resection, infrequent orientation as to the new margin surface and fragmentation- Nonetheless, tumor bed margin status is still utilized in various practice settings for patient management- However, the challenge for pathologists is to arrive at a \"final\" margin status, integrating both tumor bed and specimen margin status- As it is in multipart resections, the pathologist's ability to confidently establish the relationship between the main resected specimen and additional, separately submitted parts and to assess the adequacy of excision is compromised+ To optimize reporting, both specimen margin and tumor bed margin status should thus be reported separately\n            - \"Final\" margin status then becomes a multidisciplinary integration of these findings- For instance, in cases with differing margin statuses (i.e. resection specimen margin positive, corresponding tumor bed margin negative), the small size and lack of orientation of the tumor bed margin may preclude a reliable conversion to final negative margin- Conversely, in some cases the tumor bed specimen (e.g. revision of margin) may be a reliable indicator of a true final margin- This is a judgment call that requires close interaction between the surgeon and pathologist but generally, the following basic requirements are met:\n                    1. Tumor bed margins are quite large (i.e. thick enough to be readily processed as radial margins and large enough to match the corresponding aspect of the main specimen margin)- Are oriented as to the new true margin surface (by ink or stitch)- Physical relationship between the main resection specimen and additional tumor bed margins is confirmed by pathologist and surgeon (usually through unequivocal labeling and even fitting the tumor bed margin to the main specimen)- In such a case, the tumor bed margin could be considered a final margin* **Worst pattern of invasion (WPOI)** ([AJCC: Cancer Staging [Accessed 21 September 2018]](https://cancerstaging.org/Pages/default.aspx), [CAP: Protocol for the Examination of Specimens from Patients with Cancers of the Lip and Oral Cavity [Accessed 29 December 2020]](https://cap.objects.frb.io/protocols/cp-headandneck-lip-oralcavity-17protocol-4001.pdf)):\n          + Validated outcome predictor for oral cavity squamous carcinoma patients in multivariate analysis+ To simplify prognostication and enhance adaptation, the only cutpoint recommended for assessment is whether or not WPOI-5 is present+ WPOI-5 is defined as tumor dispersion of ≥ 1 mm between tumor satellites+ Tumor dispersion is assessed at the advancing tumor edge+ To some, WPOI can be viewed as redundant and only optional for reporting purposes, as extratumoral perineural invasion or extratumoral lymphovascular invasion also count as WPOI-5"
