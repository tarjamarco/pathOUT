koilocytosis may also be noted\n                  - Both phenomena are cytopathic effects of an Epstein-Barr virus infection+ Candidal organisms may be seen in the superficial epithelium, though an inflammatory response is typically absent* [Dysplasia (unifocal)](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/oralcavitydysplasia.html):\n              + Expansion of basilar compartment and teardrop shaped rete ridges+ Nuclear and cellular pleomorphism with increased N:C ratio\n                  - Nuclei may be hyperchromatic+ Increased mitotic activity, single cell dyskeratosis and glassy appearance of some keratinocytes* [Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL)](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/oralcavityverrucoushyperplasia.html):\n                + Skip lesions consisting of sharply demarcated, alternating segments of orthokeratin and parakeratin\n                  - The keratin layer exhibits a verrucous / spiky architecture+ Rete ridges may be bulbous, interconnect and exhibit downward pushing\n                    - This architectural dysplasia may obscure cytologic atypia+ Epithelium may be atrophic in some instances* [Verrucous carcinoma](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/oralcavityverrucous.html):\n                  + Verrucous / papillary keratosis of the surface epithelium\n                    - Chevroning and deep keratin clefting are also noted+ Broad, frond-like, bulbous rete ridges that demonstrate endophytic growth into the submucosa\n                      - Basement membrane remains intact+ Keratinocytes are bland with minimal cytologic atypia* [Hyperplastic candidiasis](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/oralcavityinfectionsgeneral.html):\n                    + Keratosis and acanthosis of the surface epithelium+ Pseudohyphae are present in the stratum corneum and are oriented perpendicular to the epithelium+ Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia including elongated and bulbous rete ridges with a downward proliferating architecture; no cytologic atypia is observed+ Underlying chronic inflammation with transmigratory neutrophils forming microabscesses in the stratum granulosum* [Lichen planus (plaque form)](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/oralcavitylichenplanus.html):\n                      + Orthokeratosis or parakeratosis of the surface epithelium with Civatte bodies scattered throughout+ Thickening of the basement membrane and hydropic degeneration of the basal cell layer\n                          - Hydropic degeneration of the basal cell layer may cause the rete ridges to appear saw toothed+ Dense band of lymphohistiocytic inflammation immediately subjacent to the surface epithelium* [Dyskeratosis congenita](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/bonemarrowdyskeratosiscongenita.html):\n                        + Orthokeratosis and atrophy of the squamous epithelium+ Over time, the lesions of this condition develop dysplastic changes and evolve into squamous cell carcinoma"
