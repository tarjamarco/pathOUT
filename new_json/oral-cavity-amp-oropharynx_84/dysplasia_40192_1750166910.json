There is a broad area of mucosal dysplastic changes ranging from low to high grade dysplasia. The latter is characterized by moderately thickened mucosa with atypical squamous cells involving almost full thickness of the epithelium. There is loss of polarity, increased nuclear size, hyperchromasia and pleomorphism with readily seen nucleoli. Suprabasal mitoses are noted including a few atypical forms. There is focal superficial excoriation and acute inflammation, with isolated fungal hyphae seen on dPAS stain. No invasive carcinoma is identified. The high grade dysplasia is 2 mm away from the closest peripheral margin, midline, while low grade dysplasia is seen focally at the anterior margin."
