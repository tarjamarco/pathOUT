Laboratory data: serum amylase 123 IU/mL, serum lipase 170 IU/mL, serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL (baseline 0.9 mg/dL).+ Microscopic description\n          - 6 lobules of pancreatic parenchyma are sampled. The septa show variable numbers of lymphocytes, including activated lymphocytes, with admixed eosinophils, from scattered cells to groups and clusters. Several ducts show intraepithelial lymphocytes with associated vacuolization and detachment of ductal epithelium. A few venules display circumferential cuffing, activated endothelium and subendothelial lymphocytes. Some lobules display small foci of lymphocytes with no appreciable acinar cell damage. There is mild fibrosis involving ~15% of the biopsy core surface, with peripheral acinar erosion. Unremarkable medium caliber arteries are present.+ Special stains\n            - The C4d immunoperoxidase stain is negative- The immunoperoxidase stains for CD3 and CD68 demonstrate increased numbers of septal and acinar T lymphocytes and macrophages"
