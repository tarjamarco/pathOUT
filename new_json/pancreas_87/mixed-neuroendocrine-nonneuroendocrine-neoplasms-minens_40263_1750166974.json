The neuroendocrine component comprises approximately 60% of the tumor and is characterized by infiltrating sheets and nests of high grade tumor cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin and viably prominent nucleoli. Frequent mitoses are noted (up to 25/HPF). Areas of tumor necrosis are identified. A well differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma component, characterized by infiltrating well formed tubules, is seen intricately associated with the neuroendocrine carcinoma component. Neuroendocrine carcinoma shows diffuse and strong expression for neuroendocrine markers chromogranin and synaptophysin. The ductal carcinoma component is negative for neuroendocrine markers. Neuroendocrine carcinoma shows a Ki67 proliferative index of approximately 90%. Overall, the findings are consistent with mixed ductal neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas."
