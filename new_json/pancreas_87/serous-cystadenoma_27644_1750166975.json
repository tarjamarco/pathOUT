    "clean_content": "Sample pathology report\n\n* Partial distal pancreatectomy:\n  + Serous cystadenoma (see comment)+ Comment: There are multiple cystic spaces lined by a simple cuboidal to flattened epithelium with round, uniform nuclei and clear cytoplasm. Significant nuclear atypia or mitotic activity was not seen. There is some acellular fibrous tissue with a variable degree of hyalinization and edematous change in the stroma. Immunohistochemically the tumor cells are positive with EMA and MUC1 while negative for HMB45. The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with pancreatic serous cystadenoma."
