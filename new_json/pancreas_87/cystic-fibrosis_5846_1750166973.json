    "clean_content": "Definition / general\n\n* Autosomal recessive disorder affecting most critically the lungs; also pancreas, liver, intestines; characterized by abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across an epithelium, leading to thick, viscous secretions ([Wikipedia: Cystic Fibrosis [Accessed 11 December 2017]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis))* Incidence: 1 in 20 in U.S. are carriers* Most common mutation is #708 (seen in 70% with disease)* Mutations cause reduced chloride ion in secretions, thicker respiratory secretions, upper respiratory infections* Complications: pancreatic insufficiency late in disease course in 90%, diabetes, malabsorption, pancreatitis* Mutations also cause defective cilia and infertility; may cause meconium ileus (5 - 10%), intussusception* Cysts form secondary to ductal obstruction due to thick, tenacious secretions, variable numbers of cysts range from 1 to 3 mm, very rarely entire pancreas replaced by multiple macroscopic cysts, termed \"pancreatic cystosis\""
