    "clean_content": "Procedure\n\n**Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) specimens:**\n\n* Orientation and external examination\n  + Specimen consists of pancreatic head and duodenum and occasionally distal stomach and gallbladder+ Examine the specimen freshly+ Measure the overall specimen and each organ / structure+ Identify the trapezoid:\n          - There is a trapezoid shaped area in the posteromedian aspect of the pancreatic head ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))- The center of the trapezoid is a concave, smooth and shiny surfaced firm area, on which the superior mesenteric vein / portal vein and superior mesenteric artery lie- This area is referred to as the vascular groove or vascular bed (see [figure 1](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))+ Identify and ink the important structures and margins:\n            - Trapezoid is formed by the pancreatic neck margin on the left, the uncinate margin on the right and the common bile duct (CBD) on the top (see [figure 1](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))- Pancreatic duct (PD) is in the upper half of the pancreatic neck margin towards the vascular groove- Ink the pancreatic neck margin, uncinate margin and common bile duct margin with different colors (e.g., green, black and red, respectively) (see [figure 2](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))- Although it is not a surgical margin, ink the vascular groove area (e.g., orange) as well, after checking if it includes a portion of the portal vein ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))+ Check if a portion of the portal vein is present in the vascular groove area: if present, ink the superior and inferior margins using different colors+ Identify and ink the anterior and posterior free peritoneal surfaces:\n                - Anterior free surface is convex shaped and contains abundant fat tissue- Pancreatic head - duodenum transition is abrupt and easily identifiable on this surface (see [figure 3](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))- However, the posterior free surface is flat and shiny in appearance while the pancreatic head - duodenum transition in this area is smoother and barely identifiable (see [figure 4](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))- If not sutured or stapled, the common bile duct margin can be seen readily on this aspect- Although they are not surgical margins, it is encouraged to ink the anterior and posterior free surfaces in different colors (e.g., blue for anterior, black for posterior) ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))* Removing the margins\n    + Bile duct margin:\n      - Shave and submit enface (see [figure 5](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages)) ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))- Bile duct margin corresponds to the CBD margin in most of the specimens- However, if gallbladder is attached to the specimen, it corresponds to common hepatic duct (CHD) margin- If the specimen includes cystic duct (CD) without attached gallbladder, it corresponds to both CHD and CD margins+ Pancreatic neck margin (including PD): shave and submit enface (see [figure 6](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages)) ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))+ Uncinate (retroperitoneal or posteroinferior or superior mesenteric artery) margin:\n          - This margin is formed by blunt dissection of the pancreatic head from the retroperitoneal soft tissues in the posterior inferior aspect of the uncinate process, rather than a surgical cut- Shave and submit entirely as 3 - 4 mm thick bread loaf sections in 2 or 3 cassettes (see [figure 7](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages)) ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))+ Portal vein margins (if present): superior and inferior margins of the vein can be shaved and submitted enface or can be submitted as a part of the main perpendicular sections of the vessel wall+ Vascular groove (vascular bed or superior mesenteric / portal vein bed) surface:\n              - Submitting 1 perpendicular section that shows the area closest to the tumor is enough for most of the cases- However, shaving and submitting bread loaf sections just like the uncinate margin is another option+ Proximal (stomach / duodenum) and distal (duodenum) margins: submit 1 shaved section from each margin* Opening the duodenum and examining intraduodenal aspect\n      + Open through the antipancreatic (antiampullary) border ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))+ Inspect the ampullary region to identify and describe any lesions (e.g., intra / periampullary localization; mass forming, papillary or mucinous features, etc.)+ Inspect the minor (accessory) ampulla, if present:\n            - It is located ~2 cm anterior and superior to the main ampulla and looks like a small bump / nodule / polyp (see [figure 8](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))- In some cases, the PD might open into minor ampulla ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))* Bivalving and sectioning\n        + Although there are several approaches in sectioning the pancreatic head, bivalving is the most commonly used method as it allows for assessment of the relation of tumor with both the CBD and PD and for proper evaluation and documentation of ampullary tumors ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))+ Bivalve the pancreatic head by placing the probes in the CBD and PD to the ampulla; probe the CBD all the way to the ampulla and the PD at least as far as it can be traced+ Start sectioning using a long knife (e.g., 6 inches)\n              - Knife needs to be angled as if cutting the probes themselves (see [figure 9](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))- Carefully examine and re-angle after each stroke ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278))- Finally, the pancreatic head should be separated into anterior and posterior halves (see [figure 10](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))* Identifying the tumor(s)\n          + Inspect and describe the following features of the tumor(s): localization, size (measurements), characteristics (e.g., color, solid / cystic, necrotic / hemorrhagic / papillary areas, soft / firm, well circumscribed / ill defined), association with / distance from the CBD, PD, ampulla, margins and surfaces+ Harvest fresh tumor samples for the tumor bank as needed* Identifying variant anatomies (i.e., low union)\n            + Normal (most common) insertion of the CD into the CHD is at least 5 mm above the pancreatic parenchyma border+ Other levels of insertion (i.e., within the 5 mm of pancreatic parenchyma border or even intrapancreatic) are considered as low union, which have been shown to play a significant role in pancreatobiliary and periampullary carcinogenesis ([HPB (Oxford) 2020;22:1675](32336556))+ Therefore, when present, it should be documented (see [figure 11](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))* Lymph node dissection\n              + Peripancreatic lymph nodes are separated into 8 regions as peri-CBD, anterior pancreatic, anterior pancreatoduodenal, superior pancreatic, inferior pancreatic, posterior pancreatic, posterior pancreatoduodenal and uncinate margin lymph nodes; however, these regions currently do not play any role in pN staging+ Shave off all peripancreatic soft tissues using the orange peeling method (see [figures 12 and 13](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages)) including the priorly inked anterior and posterior free surfaces ([Am J Surg Pathol 2014;38:480](24451278), [Mod Pathol 2009;22:107](18820663))\n                  - Submit entirely in subsequent cassettes- Make a note of sectioned lymph nodes to prevent overcounting+ Dissect and submit perigastric and periduodenal lymph nodes using conventional methods* Fixation and harvesting\n                + Let the specimen be properly fixed in formalin for 24 - 48 hours+ After fixation, submit at least 1 section per centimeter of the tumor for solid tumors\n                    - Increase the number of the sections or even submit it entirely if the tumor was treated ([Am J Surg Pathol 2022;46:754](34889852))- Unless there is a grossly visible invasion, cystic / intraductal tumors should be submitted entirely to rule out invasion ([Ann Surg 2016;263:162](25775066))+ Include proper sections to show any association between the tumor and important structures (i.e., ampulla, CBD, PD, vascular bed, duodenum, etc.)+ Include nontumoral tissue sections from the pancreas and the adjacent organs* Taking gross images\n                  + Always take several images of the specimen in both fresh (before and after inking, bivalving and sectioning) and fixed states\n\n  \n**Distal pancreatectomy specimens:**\n\n* Orientation, external examination and removing the margin\n  + Specimen consists of body and tail of the pancreas with or without spleen attached+ Freshly examine the specimen+ Measure the overall specimen and each organ / structure+ Identify splenic artery on the superior and splenic vein on the posterior surface of the pancreas (see [figures 14 and 15](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))+ Ink anterior and posterior surfaces in different colors (e.g., blue for anterior, black for posterior)+ Identify, ink and remove the pancreatic parenchymal (duct) margin; shave and submit enface* Sectioning\n    + One approach is serial sectioning of the entire pancreas and spleen at 0.5 - 1 cm intervals starting from the proximal edge of the pancreas (see [figure 16](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))+ Alternatively, entire pancreas and spleen can be bivalved and sectioned with the guidance of a probe placed in the PD, starting from the proximal edge of the pancreas (see [figure 17](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))\n        - Then, perpendicular (to the surfaces) sections are submitted from each half* Identifying the tumor(s)\n      + Inspect and describe the following features of the tumor(s): localization, size (measurements), characteristics (e.g., color, solid / cystic, necrotic / hemorrhagic / papillary areas, soft / firm, well circumscribed / ill defined), association with / distance from the PD, pancreatic parenchymal margin, anterior and posterior surfaces and spleen+ Harvest fresh tumor samples for the tumor bank as needed* Lymph node dissection\n        + Dissect the peripancreatic and splenic hilar lymph nodes using conventional methods* Fixation and harvesting\n          + Let the specimen be properly fixed in formalin for 24 - 48 hours+ After fixation, submit at least 1 section per centimeter of the tumor for solid tumors\n              - Increase the number of the sections or even submit it entirely if the tumor was treated ([Am J Surg Pathol 2022;46:754](34889852))- Unless there is a grossly visible invasion, cystic / intraductal tumors should be submitted entirely to rule out invasion ([Ann Surg 2016;263:162](25775066))+ Include proper sections to show any association between the tumor and important structures (i.e., PD, spleen, splenic hilum, etc.)+ Include nontumoral tissue sections from the pancreas and the spleen* Taking gross images\n            + Always take several images of the specimen in both fresh (before and after inking, bivalving and sectioning) and fixed states\n\n  \n**Total pancreatectomy specimens:**\n\n* Specimen consists of pancreatic head, neck, body and tail, in addition to duodenum, spleen and occasionally distal stomach and gallbladder (see [figure 18](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/pancreasgrossing.html#pancreasgrossinggrossimages))* Follow the steps for pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy for the appropriate portions of the specimen (see above)"
