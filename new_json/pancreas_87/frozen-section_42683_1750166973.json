    "clean_content": "Procedure\n\n* Frozen section for primary diagnosis:\n  + Preoperative diagnostic modalities have mostly replaced frozen section practice for primary diagnosis+ However, it is still performed on occasional cases when the preoperative cytology or biopsy was inconclusive or when there are unusual intraoperative findings ([Arch Pathol Lab Med 2022;146:84](33769446))* Frozen section for distant metastasis:\n    + Since presence of any distant metastasis means unresectable disease for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases, surgeons may send suspected tissues (e.g., liver, peritoneum, distant lymph nodes, etc.) for frozen section examination+ If it reveals metastasis, the procedure will most likely be aborted ([J Clin Pathol 2007;60:975](17369506))* Frozen section for margin status:\n      + Main purpose for this request is to evaluate the completeness of the resection ([Ann Surg Oncol 2013;20:3626](23838908))+ If the margin (i.e., pancreatic parenchyma / duct, biliary duct) is positive, the surgeon will resect additional tissue to achieve a clear margin+ For the pathologist, the main question is whether there is an invasive carcinoma or high grade dysplasia in the margin or not+ Presence of low grade dysplasia does not require further resection* Frozen section for intraductal neoplasms:\n        + Sometimes surgeons may request intraoperative examination of an intraductal neoplasm to investigate if there is high grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma+ However, both high grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma are usually focal and an invasive carcinoma component may not be easy to identify grossly+ Therefore, it is not possible to fully exclude high grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma during the frozen section and a discrepancy may occur between frozen section and permanent assessment ([Ann Surg 2016;263:162](25775066))"
