    "clean_content": "Definition / general\n\n* Sclerosing osteomyelitis has traditionally been divided into focal and diffuse types:\n  + The focal type, also known as condensing osteitis, describes a relatively common, limited, well circumscribed radiopaque alteration of bone surrounding the apex of a root of a tooth, the latter often with an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp+ Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, on the other hand, is an uncommon condition affecting a large portion of the bone, usually mandible, and is associated with mandibular expansile remodeling and clinical symptoms* Many views of DSO exist in the literature:\n    + DSO is a form of primary chronic osteomyelitis (PCO) - the remainder of this topic follows this view+ DSO is synonymous to juvenile chronic osteomyelitis and an early onset form of PCO+ DSO is a localized form of SAPHO+ DSO is distinct from PCO and the term DSO is only used when an obvious infectious process is responsible for sclerosis of bone (i.e. with a chronic intraosseous bacterial infection which creates chronically inflamed granulation tissue that incites sclerosis of the surrounding bone)+ DSO is used only as a description of radiological features* Both primary and secondary chronic osteomyelitis may demonstrate radiographic changes of extensive sclerosis with periosteal reaction (proliferative periostitis) and variable osteolysis on diagnostic imaging\n\n- Pathophysiology and etiology is unknown"

however, no infectious source is identifiable+ Most often characterized by the insidious onset of low grade fever, local swelling and bone pain+ Radiologic findings may suggest osteomyelitis, and bone seeking isotopes reveal other asymptomatic sites of involvement+ The lesions occur mainly in the metaphyses of long tubular bones, as well as the clavicles, spine, and pelvis; the lesions are sometimes symmetrically distributed+ The precise relationship between primary chronic osteomyelitis, diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, CRMO and SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) is highly debated and not clear at this time\n                  - Some consider CRMO and SAPHO as primary chronic osteomyelitis with additional extragnathic manifestations- Whether CRMO in juvenile patients and SAPHO syndrome are the same disorder in different age groups remains to be determined* **Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis and Osteitis (SAPHO)**\n        + Acronym for a complex clinical presentation that includes Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis and Osteitis+ Unknown cause but may arise in genetically predisposed individuals who develop an autoimmune disturbance due to exposure to dermatologic bacteria+ Increased prevalence of HLA-27 (10 - 15% cases of SAPHO)+ SAPHO and Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis / CRMO are distinguished from other forms of osteitis / osteomyelitis as these two diseases may have extragnathic skeletal involvement+ The precise relationship between primary chronic osteomyelitis, diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, CRMO and SAPHO is controversial - some consider CRMO and SAPHO as primary chronic osteomyelitis with additional extragnathic manifestations* **Proliferative periostitis**\n          + Represents a periosteal reaction to the presence of inflammation+ The affected periosteum forms several rows of reactive vital bone that parallel each other and expand the surface of the altered bone* **Garrè sclerosing osteomyelitis**\n            + In 1893, Swiss physician Carl Garrè reported on patterns of and complications of acute osteomyelitis+ Garrè did not have any pathologic specimens for microscopic examination nor radiographs to augment his descriptions+ Nonetheless, his name is often associated with the condition in which periosteal duplication or \"onion-skinning\" pattern of periostitis leads to enlargement of the jaw, usually mandible\n                  - Cases of osteomyelitis with a predominant periosteal reaction are in some instances falsely labeled as Garrè osteomyelitis- Garrè osteomyelitis and Garrè sclerosing osteomyelitis are often used synonymously and should be disassociated with this clinical presentation+ Note that Garrè name was and is often misspelled as Garré with an improper accent+ Numerous synonyms for Garrè sclerosing osteomyelitis have been used:\n                      - Chronic osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis- Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garrè- Chronic non-suppurative osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis- Garrè chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis- Garrè chronic nonsuppurative sclerosing osteitis- Garrè proliferative periostitis- Garrè sclerosing osteomyelitis- Ossifying periostitis- Osteomyelitis of Garrè- Osteomyelitis sicca- Osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis- Periostitis ossificans- Sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garrè+ **Condensing osteitis**\n                        - Localized areas of radiographic bone sclerosis associated with apices of inflamed, dead or dying teeth (pulpitis or pulpal necrosis)- The association with an area of inflammation, usually the apex of an associated tooth, is critical, because these lesions can resemble several other intrabony processes that produce a somewhat similar radiographic pattern- This secondary sclerosis of bone is not considered a true / classical osteomyelitis* **Zurich Classification of Osteomyelitis:**\n              + Primarily based on clinical course and imaging features+ Histopathology is considered a secondary classification criterion because findings are mostly unspecific and inconclusive by themselves; however, tissue examination is irreplaceable to confirm diagnosis, when clinical and radiological appearance are unclear / atypical, and to exclude possible differential diagnoses+ The three major classifications are:\n                  + Acute Osteomyelitis (AO)\n                  + Secondary Chronic Osteomyelitis (SCO)\n                  + Primary Chronic Osteomyelitis (PCO)\n                  + Further subclassification is based on presumed etiology and pathogenesis of disease+ These criteria are considered tertiary classification criteria, and are helpful to determine the necessary therapeutic strategies which may differ somewhat among the subgroups"
