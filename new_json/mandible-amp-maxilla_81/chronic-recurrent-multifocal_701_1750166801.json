    "clean_content": "Definition / general\n\n* Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a relapsing inflammatory disease and is considered a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy characterized by periods of exacerbations and remissions over many years* Characterized by an inflammatory process presenting with findings similar to infectious osteomyelitis; however, no infectious source is identifiable* Most often characterized by the insidious onset of low grade fever, local swelling and bone pain* Radiologic findings may suggest osteomyelitis, and bone seeking isotopes reveal other asymptomatic sites of involvement* The lesions occur mainly in the metaphyses of long tubular bones, as well as the clavicles, spine, and pelvis; the lesions are sometimes symmetrically distributed* The precise relationship between primary chronic osteomyelitis, diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, CRMO and SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) is highly debated and not clear at this time\n            + Some consider CRMO and SAPHO as primary chronic osteomyelitis with additional extragnathic manifestations+ Whether CRMO in juvenile patients and SAPHO syndrome are the same disorder in different age groups remains to be determined"

hence, the medullary cavity is also known as the marrow cavity+ The medullary cavity has walls composed of spongy bone (cancellous bone) and is lined by endosteum, which are osteoprogenitor cells* **Osteochemonecrosis of Jaws:**\n                      + Synonyms: bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaws, bisphosphonate induced osteonecrosis of the jaw, osteonecrosis of jaw, bisphosphonate osteonecrosis, bis-phossy jaw+ Necrosis of bone related to long term use of antiresorptive medications such as bisphosphonate medications and altered bone metabolism+ Osteoclasts are thought to be qualitatively impaired, particularly with intravenous forms of bisphosphonate medication which leads to inadequate remodeling of bone, necrosis* **Osteoradionecrosis (ORN):**\n                        + Clinically, a chronic non-healing wound of the affected jaw (most commonly mandible), typically with exposure of bone, in a patient with a history of radiation therapy to the head and neck region+ Radiation injury to jaw that leads to ORN results from chronic hypovascularity, hypocellularity of marrow space and ultimately hypoxemia+ Is more similar to avascular necrosis of bone than primary infection of bone, although infection or bacterial colonization can occur* **Periapical granuloma:**\n                          + Acute or chronic inflammation admixed with fibrous or granulation tissue locally at the apical or periapical region of a tooth+ Is devoid of epithelium (i.e. no cyst lining) which distinguishes it from a periapical cyst+ Periapical granuloma is located at the apex of a necrotic or partially necrotic tooth root* **Periosteum:**\n                            + Connective tissue membrane lining the outer / external surface bones, except at the joints of long bones+ Is composed of an outer fibrous layer and an inner cambium / osteogenic layer ([Wikipedia: Periosteum [Accessed 1 June 2018]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum)\n                                )* **Proliferative periostitis:**\n                              + Represents a periosteal reaction to the presence of inflammation+ The affected periosteum forms several rows of reactive vital bone that parallel each other and expand the surface of the altered bone* **SAPHO syndrome:**\n                                + SAPHO syndrome is an acronym for a complex clinical presentation that includes synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis+ The osseous lesions mirror primary chronic osteomyelitis and CRMO+ Unknown cause but thought to arise in genetically predisposed individuals who develop an autoimmune disturbance secondary to exposure to dermatologic bacteria+ Increased prevalence of HLA-27+ SAPHO and CRMO are distinguished from other forms of osteitis / osteomyelitis as these two diseases may have extragnathic skeletal involvement* **Sequestrum:**\n                                  + Predominantly non-viable bone that has become separated during the process of necrosis from the original surrounding native bone ([Medical Dictionary: sequestrum [Accessed 1 June 2018]](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sequestrectomies))* **Zurich Classification of Osteomyelitis:**\n                                    + The Zurich classification system of osteomyelitis is primarily based on clinical course and features of imaging of the disease+ Histopathology is considered a secondary classification criterion, taking into account that findings are mostly nonspecific and inconclusive by themselves; however, tissue examinations of biopsies are irreplaceable for confirmation of the diagnosis if the clinical and radiological appearance is unclear or atypical and to exclude possible differential diagnoses+ The three major classifications are: ([Baltensperger, Osteomyelitis of the Jaws: Definition and Classification (Figure 2.2)](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCMQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783540287643-c1.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-643702-p97833534&ei=S9awU77vFMeNyASB74DYDA&usg=AFQjCNFwgkIONM-AqbUsJ8SOvFBkGJIsfg&bvm=bv.69837884,d.aWw))\n                                          - Acute Osteomyelitis (AO)- Secondary Chronic Osteomyelitis (SCO)- Primary Chronic Osteomyelitis (PCO)+ Further subclassification of these major osteomyelitis groups is based on presumed etiology and pathogenesis of disease+ These criteria are therefore considered a tertiary classification criteria+ These tertiary criteria help determine the necessary therapeutic strategies which may differ somewhat among the subgroups"
