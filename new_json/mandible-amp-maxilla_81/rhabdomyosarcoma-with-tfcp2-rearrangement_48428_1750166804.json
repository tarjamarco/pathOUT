The tumor is composed of fascicles and whorls of spindle shaped cells with elongated nuclei and small to moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are hyperchromatic and show moderate nuclear pleomorphism. Mitotic rate is focally elevated. The tumor demonstrates variable cellularity with the intraosseous component demonstrating areas of high cellularity and marked nuclear pleomorphism. Occasional rhabdomyoblasts are present in the center of the tumor. There is extensive bone destruction and the tumor infiltrates into the adjacent soft tissues and the submucosal tissues in the left gingivolabial region. The tumor is focally seen in the submucosa of the respiratory epithelium lining the left nasal floor. In these areas, the tumor demonstrates an infiltrative growth pattern and mild nuclear pleomorphism. The tumor extends to margins at the left maxillary tuberosity and the gingival submucosal tissues around tooth 25. Immunohistochemistry (with working external controls) shows strong diffuse staining in malignant cells for desmin, MyoD1 and ALK1 (D5F3). There is patchy positive staining for AE1 / AE3. Malignant cells are negative for p40, high molecular weight cytokeratin and SOX10. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (dual color break apart probe) shows a split signal for *TFCP2*."
