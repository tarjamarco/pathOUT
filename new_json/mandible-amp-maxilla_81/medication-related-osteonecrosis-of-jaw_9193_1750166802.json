    "clean_content": "Definition / general\n\n* Medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is an adverse drug reaction consisting of progressive bone destruction in the maxillofacial region of patients under current or previous treatment with antiresorptive and antiangiogenic medications* In 2014, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons suggested a nomenclature change from Bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) to MRONJ to accommodate the growing number of gnathic osteonecrosis cases associated with other antiresorptive (denosumab) and antiangiogenic therapies"

however, no infectious source is identifiable+ Characterized by insidious onset of low grade fever, local swelling and bone pain+ Radiologic findings may suggest osteomyelitis, and bone seeking isotopes reveal other asymptomatic sites of involvement+ Lesions occur mainly in metaphyses of long tubular bones, as well as clavicles, spine, and pelvis; lesions are sometimes symmetrically distributed+ Precise relationship between primary chronic osteomyelitis, diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, CRMO and SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) is highly debated and not clear at this time+ Some consider CRMO and SAPHO as primary chronic osteomyelitis with additional extragnathic manifestations* **Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis / diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis:**\n              + Although the term is usually used synonymously with primary chronic osteomyelitis, it represents a description of a strictly radiological appearance that can be caused by several similar processes, including:\n                - Primary and secondary chronic osteomyelitis- Chronic tendoperiostitis- Ossifying periostitis or Garrè osteomyelitis- Medullary osseous infection, probably bacterial, which induces the complete sclerosis\n                        * Favors young women, is painful and appears radiographically as medullary sclerosis* Therapy includes antibiotics and surgical debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in refractory cases* **Cortical bone:**\n                + Cortical bone, synonymous with compact bone, is one of the two types of osseous tissue that forms bone+ As its name implies, cortical bone forms the cortex, or outer shell, of most bones+ Compact bone, as its name implies, is much denser than cancellous bone which is the other type of osseous tissue+ Furthermore, it is harder, stronger and stiffer than cancellous bone* **Garrè sclerosing osteomyelitis:**\n                  + In 1893, a Swiss physician, Carl Garrè, reported on patterns of acute osteomyelitis+ Garrè did not have any pathologic specimens for microscopic examination nor radiographs to augment his descriptions+ Nonetheless, his name is often associated with the condition in which periosteal duplication, or an \"onion-skinning\" pattern of periostitis, leads to enlargement of the jaw, usually mandible* **Involucrum:**\n                    + A sheath of new bone surrounding the sequestrum ([N Engl J Med 2007; 356:e7](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm055247))* **Medullary bone / medullary cavity / marrow cavity:**\n                      + The medullary cavity (medulla, innermost part) of bone is the central cavity where red bone marrow or yellow bone marrow (adipose tissue) is stored; hence, the medullary cavity is also known as the marrow cavity+ The medullary cavity has walls composed of spongy bone (cancellous bone) and is lined by endosteum, which are osteoprogenitor cells* **Osteoradionecrosis (ORN)**\n                        + Exposed, devitalized bone in radiated field with no healing for 3 months and no evidence of tumor recurrence+ Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is considered a late effect of a radiation induced fibroatrophic process but is not considered as primary osteomyelitis+ Is more similar to aseptic / avascular necrosis of bone than primary infection of bone, although infection or bacterial colonization can occur* **Periapical granuloma**\n                          + Acute and / or chronic inflammation admixed with fibrous or granulation tissue locally at the apical or periapical region of a tooth+ Is devoid of epithelium (i.e. no cyst lining), which distinguishes it from a periapical cyst+ Periapical granuloma is located at the apex of a necrotic or partially necrotic tooth root* **SAPHO syndrome:**\n                            + SAPHO syndrome is an acronym for a complex clinical presentation that includes synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis+ The osseous lesions mirror primary chronic osteomyelitis and CRMO+ Unknown cause but thought to arise in genetically predisposed individuals who develop an autoimmune disturbance secondary to exposure to dermatologic bacteria+ Increased prevalence of HLA-27+ SAPHO and CRMO are distinguished from other forms of osteitis / osteomyelitis as these two diseases may have extragnathic skeletal involvement* **Sequestrum:**\n                              + Predominantly nonviable bone that has become separated during the process of necrosis from the original surrounding native bone ([Medical Dictionary: sequestrum [Accessed 4 June 2018]](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sequestrectomies))* **Zurich Classification of Osteomyelitis:**\n                                + The Zurich classification system of osteomyelitis is primarily based on clinical course and features of imaging of the disease+ Histopathology is considered a secondary classification criterion, taking into account that findings are mostly unspecific and inconclusive when considered by themselves; however, tissue examinations of biopsies are irreplaceable for confirmation of the diagnosis, in cases of unclear and atypical clinical and radiological appearance, and moreover in excluding possible differential diagnoses+ The three major classifications are: ([Baltensperger, Osteomyelitis of the Jaws: Definition and Classification (Figure 2.2)](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCMQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783540287643-c1.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-643702-p97833534&ei=S9awU77vFMeNyASB74DYDA&usg=AFQjCNFwgkIONM-AqbUsJ8SOvFBkGJIsfg&bvm=bv.69837884,d.aWw))\n                                      - **Acute Osteomyelitis (AO)- Secondary Chronic Osteomyelitis (SCO)- Primary Chronic Osteomyelitis (PCO)**+ Further subclassification of these major osteomyelitis groups is based on presumed etiology and pathogenesis of disease+ These criteria are therefore considered tertiary classification criteria+ These tertiary criteria are helpful in determining the necessary therapeutic strategies which may differ somewhat among the subgroups"
