however, no infectious source is identifiable+ Characterized by insidious onset of low grade fever, local swelling and bone pain+ Radiologic findings may suggest osteomyelitis, and bone seeking isotopes reveal other asymptomatic sites of involvement+ Lesions occur mainly in metaphyses of long tubular bones, as well as clavicles, spine, and pelvis; lesions are sometimes symmetrically distributed+ Precise relationship between primary chronic osteomyelitis, diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, CRMO and SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) is highly debated and not clear at this time+ Some consider CRMO and SAPHO as primary chronic osteomyelitis with additional extragnathic manifestations* **Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis / diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis:**\n          + Although the term is usually used synonymously with primary chronic osteomyelitis, it represents a description of a strictly radiological appearance that can be caused by several similar processes, including:\n            - Primary and secondary chronic osteomyelitis- Chronic tendoperiostitis- Ossifying periostitis or Garrè osteomyelitis- Medullary osseous infection, probably bacterial, which induces the complete sclerosis\n                    * Favors young women, is painful and appears radiographically as medullary sclerosis* Therapy includes antibiotics and surgical debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in refractory cases* **Cortical bone:**\n            + Cortical bone, synonymous with compact bone, is one of the two types of osseous tissue that forms bone+ As its name implies, cortical bone forms the cortex, or outer shell, of most bones+ Compact bone, as its name implies, is much denser than cancellous bone, which is the other type of osseous tissue+ Furthermore, it is harder, stronger and stiffer than cancellous bone* **Garrè sclerosing osteomyelitis:**\n              + In 1893, a Swiss physician, Carl Garrè, reported on patterns of acute osteomyelitis+ Garrè did not have any pathologic specimens for microscopic examination, nor radiographs to augment his descriptions+ Nonetheless, his name is often associated with the condition in which periosteal duplication, or an \"onion-skinning\" pattern of periostitis, leads to enlargement of the jaw, usually mandible* **Involucrum:**\n                + A sheath of new bone surrounding the sequestrum ([N Engl J Med 2007; 356:e7](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm055247))* **Medullary bone / medullary cavity / marrow cavity:**\n                  + The medullary cavity (medulla, innermost part) of bone is the central cavity where red bone marrow or yellow bone marrow (adipose tissue) is stored; hence, the medullary cavity is also known as the marrow cavity+ The medullary cavity has walls composed of spongy bone (cancellous bone) and is lined by endosteum, which are osteoprogenitor cells* **Osteochemonecrosis of Jaws:**\n                    + Synonyms: bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaws, bisphosphonate induced osteonecrosis of the jaw, osteonecrosis of jaw, bisphosphonate osteonecrosis, bis-phossy jaw+ Necrosis of bone related to long term use of antiresorptive medications such as bisphosphonate medications and altered bone metabolism+ Osteoclasts are thought to be qualitatively impaired, particularly with intravenous forms of bisphosphonate medication, which leads to inadequate remodeling of bone, necrosis* **SAPHO syndrome:**\n                      + SAPHO syndrome is an acronym for a complex clinical presentation that includes synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis+ The osseous lesions mirror primary chronic osteomyelitis and CRMO+ Unknown cause but thought to arise in genetically predisposed individuals who develop an autoimmune disturbance secondary to exposure to dermatologic bacteria+ Increased prevalence of HLA-27+ SAPHO and CRMO are distinguished from other forms of osteitis / osteomyelitis, as these two diseases may have extragnathic skeletal involvement* **Sequestrum:**\n                        + Predominantly nonviable bone that has become separated, during the process of necrosis from the original surrounding native bone ([Medical Dictionary: sequestrum [Accessed 4 June 2018]](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sequestrectomies))"
